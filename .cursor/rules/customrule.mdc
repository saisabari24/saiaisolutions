- Always use ShadCN components where applicable.

- Use Context7 MCP Tool to find applicable components and packages if you don't know about one. You can also use this to know about a library or a package.

- You can also use Serper and Fetch MCP Tools for something that Context7 can't satisfy.

- If the user provides a URL for a component or package then use the fetch tool to scrape it and use that.


- Maintain a list of used ShadCN components in ShadCN-context.md (make one if it doesn't exist). It should contain all the components used and reference this to check if you need to install a ShadCN component from scratch with the CLI tool or not
